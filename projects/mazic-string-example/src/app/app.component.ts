      Meri Bheegi Bheegi Si, Palkon Pe Reh Gayee
      On my wet eyelashes were left.

      Jaise Mere Sapne Bikhar Ke
      like my shattered dreams.

      Jale Man Tera Bhi, Kisi Ke Milan Ko
      May your mind also burn.

      Anamika, Tu Bhi Tarse
      Anamika, may you thirst for the companionship of someone.

      Meri Bheegi ...

      Tujhe Bin Jaane, Bin Pehchaane
      Without knowing you, recognizing you

      Maine Hriday Se Lagaya
      I brought you close to my heart.

      Par Mere Pyar Ke Badle Men Tuune
      But in return of my love you

      Mujhko Ye Din Dikhalaya
      showed me these days.

      Jaise Biraha Ki Ritu Maine Kati
      Like I suffered the period of separation

      Tadapake Aanhen Bhar Bhar Ke
      Tormented, sighing.

      Jale Man Tera ...
      may your mind also burn.


      Aag Se Nata, Nari Se Rishta
      A relationship with a woman is like a bond with fire.

      Kahe Man Samajh Na Paya
      Why did my mind not understand this?

      Mujhe Kya Hua Tha, Ik Bevafa Se
      What had happened to me? With an unfaithful

      Haay Mujhe Kyon Pyar Aaya
      why did I fall in love?

      Teri Bewafai Pe, Hanse Jag Sara
      The world will laugh at your infidelity

      Gali Gali Guzare Jidhar Se
      in every lane that you go by.

      Jale Man Tera ...
